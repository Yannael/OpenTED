#### Overview

#### History

* 2015/08/01: Added query builder
* 2015/06/15: Added contract flows visualization
* 2015/05/15: Initial version

#### Notes
* There are missing data in the award notices, and even erroneous data. This is independent of OpenTED data. To the best of our knowledge, data are the same as those available from the official TED EU site. Let us know if you spot any inconsistencies.

#### Code

* The interface was developed following the hackathon and discussions at the [European Investigative Journalism Conference (EIJC) 2015](http://www.journalismfund.eu/EIJC15).
* It is implemented in Shiny/R, and the code is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/Yannael/OpenTED).
