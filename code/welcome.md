Welcome to the OpenTED browser, an initiative from [OpenTED](http://ted.openspending.org/) that aims to make information from the joint European procurement system more easily accessible to journalists and researchers. 

The project aims to answer such questions as: **Who are the biggest suppliers to a local government? What goods and servies are the public bodies in a particular country purchasing? Are anti-corruption procedures being followed correctly?**

Check the <a href="http://ulb.ac.be/di/map/yleborgn/pub/presentation/LeBorgne_ECML-SoGood2016_OpenTED.pdf" target="_blank">slides of the presentation</a> at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ecmlpkdd2016sogood/" target="_blank">ECML/PKDD SoGood 2016</a>
