This interface allows you to more easily search the [TED (Tender Electronic Daily) database of European public procurements](http://ted.europa.eu/). It relies on [OpenTED](http://ted.openspending.org/), **an initiative that aims to make information from the joint European procurement system more easily accessible to journalists and researchers**. Tenders are available from 2012-01-31 up to 2015-02-27.
